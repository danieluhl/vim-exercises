# VIM Exercises

I use vscode with the vim plugin and a few of it's settings active:

- Replace with register
- Camel case motion
- Sneak
- Surround

While these are not required, there are suggestions to practice with them.

## How to

I've ordered these in order I find most common. Add one exercise each day.

Day 1: exercise 1
Day 2: exersise 1 and 2
Day 3: exersise 1, 2, and 3
etc...
